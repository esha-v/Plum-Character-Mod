Have you ever wanted to feel like baby plum the way Spider-man for the PS5 makes you FEEL like Spider-man? Well now you can!

Another Plum has innate knockback when firing, which scales with your speed! So be careful if you're at the speed cap..
Alongside that, Another Plum starts out with Neptunus to make you really FEEL like you're Baby Plum.

Another Plum starts with a custom pocket active item: Plum Recorder!
Plum Recorder has a 4 room charge and has the chance to do one of the following when used:
(%) chance to activate the &quot;Plum Flute&quot; affect, causing Baby Plum to assist Isaac for the current room
(%) chance to spawn 3 Fruity Plum familiars to assist Isaac for the current room
(%) chance to spawn 1 Fruity Plum familiar to assist Isaac for the remainder of the floor (similar to monster manual)
(%) chance to use ANY of the 3 effects listed above &amp; recharge!

Anyways thats the mod ðŸ™‚ thanks for checkin it out!</description>
